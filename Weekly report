    This weeks plan was to create a basic start up, and to get a good understanding about the project.
    The consumed time was about learning canvas, canvas will be used to create the desired animation that the website will have.
    Also the server was setup, so that each individual person can test the site, this was done with the help of Node js, and a package
    called http-server. Next week the plan is to start doing some basic programming, creating the structure for the site and deciding
    how we want the framework to look.
