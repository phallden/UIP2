    This weeks plan was to create a basic start up, and to get a good understanding about the project.
    The consumed time was about learning canvas, canvas will be used to create the desired animation that the website will have.
    Also the server was setup, so that each individual person can test the site, this was done with the help of Node js, and a package
    called http-server. Next week the plan is to start doing some basic programming, creating the structure for the site and deciding
    how we want the framework to look.

	We have started on creating the canvas and as a start we use canvas element in html and creates canvas object with the associated html element. 
	The objects is created from a constructor with related parameters (i.e velocity, size factor to parent element etc.). The objects has a draw function that is defined for the desired outcome. We have also made the canvases responsive by the use of a parent container to each canvas, these means that the canvases width is not defined in that element, instead it is defined on the parent container. In this way we can use procentage as an attribute for width.
